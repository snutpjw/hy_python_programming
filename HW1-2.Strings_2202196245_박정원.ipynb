your first lesson and hands-on lab in Python. However, there is one more thing you need to do. The Data Science community encourages sharing work. The best way to share and showcase your work is to share it on GitHub. By sharing your notebook on GitHub you are not only building your reputation with fellow data scientists, but you can also show it off when applying for a job. Even though this was your first piece of work, it is never too early to start building good habits. Please submit all your exercises to Github & let the traces in our LMS, so for me to access your work.\n","<hr>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ZPAAWlAS_LpB"},"source":["<hr>\n","<p>Copyright &copy; 2023 RYU HOKYOUNG based on 2018 IBM Developer Skills Network.
